# FastAPI FastMCP
This repository contains a FastAPI app that serves multiple endpoints of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It is designed to be a lightweight and efficient way to interact with MCP servers, providing a simple interface for users to access various functionalities.

This is still kind of a exploration project on how to best serve multiple MCP servers with FastAPI. It is not intended to be a production-ready solution, but rather a starting point for further development and experimentation.

## Exploration that has been done and future plans
- [x] Basic FastAPI app structure
- [x] Serving multiple MCP servers
- [x] Handling server lifecycles and integrate them with FastAPI
- [x] Basic tools for interacting with MCP servers
- [ ] Handling elicitations and responses both in server side and client side
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] MCP client integration

The items above may be updated as the project evolves.
